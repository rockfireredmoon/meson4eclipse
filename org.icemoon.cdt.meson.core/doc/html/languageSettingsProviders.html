	<h1>Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros, etc.</h1>
	<P>Include paths and preprocessor macros for the C/C++ indexer are supplied by
	<strong>Language Settings Providers</strong> using the
	<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/concepts/cdt_c_scanner_discovery.htm">Scanner Discovery</a> mechanism.
	</P>
	<p>The Meson for CDT plugin provides these <strong>Settings Providers</strong>:</p>

	<h3>MESON_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS Parser</h3>
	<p>This provider instructs Meson to generate a file that contains all the compiler commands-lines
	which will be executed when a project is build.<br/>
	The plugin will parse that file and feed any preprocessor include path, macros definition or 
	macros undefine that originates from your <em>MesonLists.txt</em> files to the indexer.<br/>
	Parsing is done rarely, since its internal cache is invalidated only when the
	file`s time-stamp is newer, so it should be reasonably fast.
	</p>
